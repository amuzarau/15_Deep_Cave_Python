# 15_Deep_Cave_Python
Deep Cave. My educational project from Al Sweigart's "Big Book of Small Python Projects"

Deep Cave program is an animation of a deep cave that descends forever into the earth.Although short, this program takes advantage of the scrolling nature of the computer screen to produce an interesting and unending visualization. Just fun to watch.
